# Handoff: audit-pr-ladder — 2026-08-28

## Run this first — the index, one read-only command
```bash
python3 ~/workspace/devrc/scripts/lib/subsystem_recall.py --repo ~/workspace/devrc
```
Terse pointers this doc does not carry, curated by past sessions and outliving it.
🔴 RECALL, NOT LIVE OBSERVATION — every line is a pointer to VERIFY, never a current
reading, and it may describe a gotcha already fixed. `scope-absent`/`scope-empty` means
nothing is recorded yet: ordinary, not an error, and not a clean bill of health.
Non-blocking: if it exits non-zero, print the stderr line and carry on.

## Goal
Evaluate the `audit-pr` skill against how its round-ladder actually behaves in real
sessions, then fix what the measurement exposed. It exposed that the ladder's
findings-keyed stop rule does not terminate in the guard-hardening regime.

## State now
- Branch: `main`. **Nothing of this thread is uncommitted or unpushed.** Claims released,
  worktrees removed.
- **ALL FOUR handoff ranks are CLOSED**, and every PR merged — verified by CONTENT, never
  ancestry:
  - `#1023` → `8e33bf1d` — the three main-unblockers (espanso `ask`, opencode pin, store-api
    load flake). Merged by someone else mid-audit.
  - `#1033` → `70eff59c` — audit rounds 1+2 follow-ups
  - `#1009` → `442bde83` — the RULES worktree-config surface + ceiling bump
  - `#1005` → `aaa5514c` — this doc, ranks 2–4, and the `#996` retraction
- **SHIPPED AND VERIFIED AT THE CONSUMER**, not merely deployed. `ship.sh` converged both
  hosts to `aaa5514c`; the deployed `~/.config/espanso/match/base.yml` now reads
  `:dacq search_terms = ['feedback','dispatch','process','elicit','scope','include']` with
  `ask` gone, and the live detector resolves `'ask' -> ':acq'` as a **unique** match (1, not
  2). Both keylog collectors restarted so the running processes hold it (workbench
  2360918→1440860, laptop 4136134→601904, both `running`).
- **Rank 2 closed by its OWNER, not by me.** `git status -s scripts/discord-embed-ext/` is
  empty and `main` carries `v0.3.0`. 🔴 **The observer defect this thread found is FIXED
  there** — the `found > 0 && observer` reconnect gate is gone, and the suite floor moved
  50 → 128, so the observer-lifecycle test the harness never had now exists.
- **The audit ladder ran TWO rounds and stopped.** Round 1 found 3🟡/4🟢, round 2 confirmed
  all of them fixed and found 5 more — but round 2's findings were about scaffolding round 1
  had just written, which is the attribution signal that the ladder has left the PR.
- ⚠ **No `clawgate-task:` field**: the resolver returned rc 5, 0 tasks. Its positive control
  proves the board is reachable and the token accepted — but a WRONG session id also answers
  `200` with an empty array, so that zero is **not** a clean bill of health.

## Closed investigations — both were diagnosed on 2026-08-28

### `discord-embed-ext` WIP: OWNER FOUND — an opencode session editing the base clone
- **Owner (measured, not inferred):** opencode session `ses_fbe5f77a2ffeaJr0G0S7i4lUKa`
  ("Find Discord media extension"), `directory=/home/zach/workspace/devrc` — **the base
  clone, with no worktree**. `~/.local/share/opencode/log/opencode.log` names the writes:
  `run=020e36c2 message="touching file" file=…/embed_enlarge.js` at `2026-08-29T02:07:44Z`,
  matching the file mtimes to the second. Its process is still alive (started 08-27 00:10)
  but idle since 21:08:33 — its last message is *"Deployed `v0.2.3` … Reload the extension
  in Brave."* 🔴 **It is blocked on Zach, not abandoned.**
- 🔴 **No Claude Code transcript contains an Edit/Write to that path** — searched every
  `~/.claude/projects/**/*.jsonl`, one hit and it was this session's own query. Looking only
  at Claude Code sessions would have concluded "nobody owns it". **Search BOTH runtimes.**
- **The WIP is unlanded and unique:** working-tree content matches no branch. `origin/main`
  is byte-identical to merged `#947` for all three paths, so this is newer than
  2026-08-27T23:16Z. `manifest.json` says `0.2.3`; `origin/main` says `0.1.0`.
- 🔴 **`ship.sh` baked it into the workbench generation.** `~/.local/share/discord-embed-ext`
  (what Brave loads) is `0.2.3` and carries `ATTR_CLEARED` ×5 — deployed 22:37 by this
  session's own ship run. The laptop got `0.1.0`. **Same sha, different code — confirmed
  with version numbers, not inferred.**
- **PRESERVED, not touched:** `~/workspace/.wip-preserve-discord-embed-2026-08-28/` holds
  the three files plus `discord-embed-ext.patch`; `git apply --check --reverse` confirms the
  patch matches the tree exactly. The tree itself was left dirty and unmodified — 🔴 do NOT
  `checkout --` it.
- 🔴 **A defect the owner is not looking for — REPRODUCED with both controls.** `observe()`
  calls `observer.disconnect()` unconditionally, then reconnects only `if (found > 0)`
  (`embed_enlarge.js:150–161`). Any debounced batch with no media — a typing indicator,
  scroll, presence — leaves the observer **permanently disconnected**, so no later
  attachment is ever enlarged. Measured: WIP `v0.2.3` → `connected=false`,
  `batch_seen=false`, `enlarged=false`; control `origin/main v0.1.0` → `connected=true`,
  `batch_seen=true`, `enlarged=true`. Introduced by `v0.2.2`'s "observer disconnects during
  style changes". **The session has spent 0.2.2→0.2.3 iterating on CSS selectors while its
  own observer teardown is what breaks it.**
- 🔴 **The shipped harness structurally cannot catch this.** No test calls `observe` at all;
  `FakeMutationObserver.observe/disconnect` are **no-ops** so connection state is
  unobservable, and `FakeElement` sets **no `nodeType`**, so the callback's
  `node.nodeType === 1` gate is false and `markMediaElements` is never reached. A first repro
  run looked like it reproduced and was **vacuous in both arms** (`enlarged=false`
  everywhere) until `nodeType: 1` was set on the fixtures — the positive control is what
  caught it.

### The `localverify` remote: written ONCE on 2026-08-23, and "written repeatedly" was WRONG
- **Writer (exact):** the `civit-datapacket-talos` session
  `5e58d9a0-0a99-4c9c-bf65-e40b403e4d55`, at `2026-08-23T06:06:49Z`, verifying the githooks
  pre-push gate:
  `git -C /tmp/wt-hookcheck remote add localverify /tmp/verify-remote.git`.
  🔴 **`/tmp/wt-hookcheck` was a WORKTREE OF devrc** — its own cleanup ran
  `git -C ~/workspace/devrc worktree remove --force /tmp/wt-hookcheck`. Remotes live in the
  **common** config, so the entry landed in the shared clone. That cleanup (06:07:05) removed
  the worktree, the branch and `/tmp/verify-remote.git` — but **not the remote entry**, which
  is why it pointed at a directory that does not exist.
- 🔴 **The "it is written repeatedly" reading was an empty-result error, now refuted by
  measurement.** The evidence for it was `.git/config` mtime moving; that config holds **442
  `[branch "…"]` sections**, and every `checkout -b`/`push -u` in any of ~40 agent worktrees
  appends one. A watcher run during removal caught the rival mechanism in the act: at
  `22:41:41` the remote went 2 lines → 0 (my removal), then at `22:43:49` config changed
  again with `localverify` still **0**, the diff being
  `[branch "docs/handoff-tmux-webapp-rank3-done"]` from another session. **mtime cannot
  distinguish the two writers — the content diff can.**
- **FIXED:** `git -C $DEVRC remote remove localverify`, rc 0. Removal also deleted the one
  leftover ref `refs/remotes/localverify/hookverify` (`dcda00b5`, a throwaway README append),
  recorded here so the step stays reversible. Verified gone; not re-added since.
- 🔴 **Bonus — this closes an open question in `CLAUDE.md`.** The same session set devrc's
  repo-local `core.hooksPath` at `2026-08-21T22:16:14Z` and unset it itself at
  `2026-08-23T21:32:51Z`. That is the `githooks/` sighting CLAUDE.md records as coming "from
  something else". It does **not** explain the 08-20 `.git/hooks` sightings in devrc and
  homelab-talos — those remain unattributed, and the value is still volatile, so keep
  measuring it rather than trusting prose.
- 🔴 **The generalisable hazard: a worktree does NOT isolate the REMOTE SET, or any
  `git config` write.** `git remote add`, `git config --local`, `core.hooksPath` all land in
  the common config and are seen by every worktree and the base clone. Belongs with the
  other "surfaces a worktree does not hand you" in `claude/RULES.md`.

## Next steps (ranked)
1. **Merge `#1035`** (repo: `devrc`, `nix/pkgs/tools/default.nix`) — a one-line fix for the
   stale nixpkgs rev *this thread introduced*. Diff reviewed and the ground truth verified
   against `flake.lock` independently; only its checks were outstanding.
2. **Close `#1041` as redundant** (repo: `devrc`) — it opens a PR for commit `8d1f6671`,
   which is the closed `#1015`'s commit, on the premise that it "never had one raised". It
   did, and `HANG_TIMEOUT = 60.0` has been on `main` since `8e33bf1d` (18:37) — `#1041` was
   opened at 20:26, ~2h later. Merging it is a no-op at best. **Comment before closing** so
   that session stops work rather than re-opening; its measurement is worth keeping.
3. **Tekton capacity** (repo: `homelab-talos` / the `tekton` skill, NOT devrc) — the real
   fix behind rank 2's evidence. Needs a decision on whether it becomes work at all; see the
   open investigation above for why it is not filed.

## Gotchas / decisions / dead-ends
- 🔴 **The ladder never returned a clean round in twelve.** The stop rule assumes
  convergence; in the guard-hardening regime each fix writes guards that become the next
  round's audit surface. Stopped on a stated criterion instead: no 🔴, no blast radius
  beyond "the brief contains a false sentence", and the recurring shape swept at EVERY
  consumer of the touched predicate. Full evidence in
  `claude/skills/audit-pr/reference/round-ladder-evidence.md` (landed by `#993`).
- 🔴 **The `#900` attribution gate cannot rescue a ladder whose payload IS PROSE.** It
  stops after two zero-payload rounds; here "fixed a defect" and "reworded a warning" are
  frequently the same edit. Structural blind spot on any generator/docs/prompt PR.
- **Nine instances of one shape**, each a predicate read as a STRONGER fact than it
  carries. Twice it was *a default stated as a fact* (`baseRefName or "main"`, then
  `REPO_UNKNOWN`'s own sentinel text). Sweep every consumer of a predicate you touch.
- **`--deselect` with an ABSOLUTE path matches nothing and pytest is silent.** Positive
  control: absolute → 9789 collected (inert), relative → 9187/9789 (602 deselected).
- **`-q -q` suppresses pytest's `N passed` line entirely**, leaving only a piped exit
  status — which is `tail`'s, not pytest's.
- **`$(...)` strips trailing newlines**, so a newline-rejection probe passes vacuously
  through command substitution; pass the value through argv instead.
- **`gh` has no `baseRefteName`-style `baseRepository` field** — use `url` +
  `isCrossRepository`.
- **Editing a file in the shared clone while it sits on `main`** violates
  feature-branches-only. Recovery used here: save the edit aside, `git checkout --` to
  restore byte-identical to HEAD, redo in a branch worktree.
- **A rescued commit gets a PR for a reason** — `#979` was already live on the workbench
  and its required check caught a real defect (`ask` gone ambiguous).
- **Five flakes in `test_subsystem_store_api.py` in one day**, all on unrelated PRs, and
  its assertion message described the OPPOSITE of the failure (`len(answers) == 0`,
  `raw == b''`, under the text "a second response followed the 200"). Four cycles were lost
  to that message before a pod was read in time. 🔴 **NOT CLOSED — this doc previously
  said `#996` closed it, and 2026-08-29 falsifies that.** `#996` fixed audit ordering and
  serialised the sink; it never touched the CLIENT bound, which is where the flake
  actually lives. The same file went red again on `TestTheActorComesFromTheTOKEN`, on
  MULTIPLE unrelated PRs at once, out of `socket.py` with `TimeoutError` — a 15 s
  localhost read losing the scheduler while 12 Tekton pipelineruns shared the node and
  this suite ran 637 s under xdist. **6 of 10 devrc runs in one window failed this way.**
  Fix in `#1015` (one `HANG_TIMEOUT`, 15 s → 60 s, hang-detector proven still to fire at
  the new bound). 🔴 That is the SYMPTOM: the cause is a 10-minute parallel suite
  competing with a saturated cluster, which is Tekton capacity and not this repo's file.
- 🔴 **A fix landing is not the same as a family closing** — and the tell is that the
  claim was written from the fix's *description* rather than from what it touched. Before
  writing "closed", name the mechanism and check the fix actually reaches it.

- 🔴 **CARRIED FORWARD from the ranked list, which this update replaces — corrections to
  `#1023`'s own commit messages, kept because that history is MERGED and will not be
  rewritten.** (a) the espanso trade-off is **9** lost multi-word queries, not 8 — `ask agent`
  also stops reaching `:dacq`, via the label word `subagent`, and `--diff-config`'s probe
  universe forms two-token pairs WITHIN ONE SNIPPET so that pair never exists to be tested;
  the claim that matters — none of the 9 has ever been typed — still holds. (b) **"56
  recovered fires" measures ATTRIBUTION, not intent**: those fires were unattributable by
  construction, so the share that *meant* `:dacq` is unmeasurable, and `ask` no longer lists
  `:dacq` at all (2 picker rows → 1) while `:dacq` keeps all 8 of its unique routes. A
  legitimate, tool-sanctioned remedy — but not pure gain.
- 🔴 **THREE miscounted self-reports in one ladder, the last inside the guard written to
  stop them.** "all 7 sites" (6), "NINE settimeout sites" (8), "8 lost espanso queries" (9).
  Each was a number I produced and then trusted instead of re-deriving. The last is the
  sharpest: it came from counting `grep -n 'settimeout('` OUTPUT LINES, one of which was the
  docstring *mentioning* the name I was counting. **A grep counts MENTIONS; an AST walk
  counts CALLS.** Re-derive every count from the tree at the moment you quote it.
- 🔴 **Several of this thread's wrong claims were true of the INSTRUMENT, not the FILE.** A
  literal-string grep reported as a property of the tree; a `-k` filter that deselected the
  failing test and returned a confident "5 passed"; `xargs -0 command grep` returning a
  silent zero because `command` is a shell BUILTIN with no executable to run. Two of those
  stacked into a confident *"unexplained — same tree, opposite results"* about the opencode
  failure, which in fact reproduced locally in one run against the right file. **Before
  quoting a zero, make the instrument produce a non-zero on a case you know is there.**
- 🔴 **A DETECTOR-DRIVEN FIX INHERITS THE DETECTOR'S BLIND SPOT.** The pin re-key was
  line-targeted at what the ledger flagged, and the ledger only sees version literals — so a
  stale *rev* on a line with no version survived, untouched and unreported (`#1035`). Ask
  what the detector CANNOT see before treating its output as the work list.
- 🔴 **Neither PR could go green alone — a DEADLOCK, not a preference.** `#1015`/`#1021`/
  `#1022` each fixed one of three independent reds, and the gate runs the whole suite, so
  each red-tested the others' bug. Combining them into `#1023` was the only path to a green
  run. When several PRs each fix part of a repo-wide red, expect this and plan for one branch.
- **A ledger SNIPPET or COMMENT containing a version literal is itself a claim in the pin
  surface** — the entry's own source line becomes an old-version line and matches twice.
  Every entry is version-free for this reason. Tripped twice in one session, the second time
  in the comment written to explain it.
- **`settimeout(None)` survived the drain guard's first draft, fully green.** `ast.unparse`
  renders it `"None"`, which is not `.isdigit()`, so a size-based arm cannot see the one
  value that means *block forever*. Guards over rendered source need an explicit arm per
  non-numeric hazard.
- 🔴 **The store-api timeout fix is a SYMPTOM fix and the label was load-bearing.** It was
  shipped saying so, and `#1009` then failed at the new 60 s bound. Do not read `#1023` as
  having fixed the flake.

```
## Open investigations — live diagnosis state

### 🔴 A stale claim I introduced in `#1023`, still on `main` — fix open as `#1035`
- **Symptom + exact repro:**
  `git -C ~/workspace/devrc show origin/main:nix/pkgs/tools/default.nix | sed -n '22,24p'`
  → `MEASURED at flake.lock's nixpkgs rev 5c680dac9f02, `pkgs.opencode` is 1.18.21 — store
  path /nix/store/iqc8xfx…-opencode-1.18.21`. **One sentence, two halves, disagreeing.**
- **Observed (with values):** `origin/main`'s `flake.lock` pins nixpkgs at **`c27cdad491a9`**
  (read from the lock's `nodes.nixpkgs.locked.rev`), and the store path quoted in that same
  sentence is the one *that* rev produces. So the rev is the only stale half.
- **Ruled out:** not a second occurrence of the version drift — the VERSION and the STORE
  PATH on lines 23–24 are both correct. Only the rev on line 22 is wrong.
- 🔴 **Root cause, and it generalises:** the re-key was line-targeted at exactly the lines
  the pin-surface ledger flagged, and **that ledger only flags VERSION literals**. Line 22
  carries a *rev* and no version, so it was structurally invisible to the detector and
  therefore invisible to a fix driven by the detector. **A fix driven by a detector is only
  as wide as what the detector can see** — the method was sound and its blind spot was
  inherited whole.
- **Next probe:** none needed, the diagnosis is complete. `#1035` is a correct one-line fix
  by another session; merge it when its checks land.

### The Tekton capacity problem — now with numbers, still unowned
- **Symptom + exact repro:** `tekton/devrc-pytests` fails on unrelated commits, blocking
  every open PR rather than catching defects in any of them.
- **Observed (with values):** `#1009`'s post-rebase run failed **at the 60 s bound** —
  `TimeoutError` at `socket.py:720`, `1 failed, 10031 passed` in `721.93s`. A localhost
  round-trip that did not complete in a minute. Independently, `#1041` measured the retained
  `devrc-ci` runs: **17 failed / 6 succeeded — a 26% pass rate**, six failing runs on six
  different commits, **each failing a DIFFERENT single test** out of ~18,555.
- **Ruled out:** not a defect in any of those PRs (six different tests, six different
  commits); not the store-api client bound alone (`#1023` raised it and the failure recurred
  at the new bound).
- **Leading hypothesis:** a ~12-minute xdist suite competing with a saturated cluster. The
  store-api timeout was one of **six** symptoms; raising it fixed one.
- 🔴 **DELIBERATELY NOT FILED as a work item.** It has no closing condition anyone can check
  and no named owner, so a ticket would read as covered while nothing could close it — see
  the object-leak rule. Recorded here as an open, unowned condition instead.
