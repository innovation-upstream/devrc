"""Merge an UPDATE into an existing session-handoff doc, behind a real gate.

The write half of `/handoff` when a handoff doc for this topic ALREADY EXISTS —
step 2 of the skill writes a doc from scratch, and this is what runs the second
and every later time. (A missing base is handled rather than refused: the update
simply becomes the whole doc, so nothing here breaks if the skill ever routes a
first write through it too.) It exists because of a measured incident:

  A session re-entered work from a handoff, did ten minutes of genuinely
  valuable analysis — it answered the doc's open question AND corrected a prior
  misreading — and then wrote and PUSHED an updated handoff to a shared
  branch with no confirm gate at all. The operator never approved it.

Both skills involved were correct on their own terms. `/resume` is read-only by
contract and followed it. `/handoff` gates its *index* write ("Write only on
explicit confirm, diff first … on decline, discard"). The gap was underneath:
the handoff DOC's own write+push carried no equivalent gate, and a session
running after a resume inherited no constraint at all.

FOUR RULES, and this module is what makes three of them structural rather than
prose an agent can read and then not follow:

a. UPDATING IS NOT FORBIDDEN. The incident's update was correct and valuable;
   suppressing it costs the next session the ten minutes again. Optimising for
   doc stability over state accuracy is backwards. So this tool exists to make
   the update SAFE, not to make it rare — there is no "don't update" path here.

b. THE GATE IS ON THE PUSH, and it is the SAME gate shape `/handoff` already
   specifies for the index write: one compact unified diff, a single y/N, and
   on decline DISCARD. Structurally: the default mode writes NOTHING — not the
   doc, not a commit, not a ref — it only prints the diff a human is being
   asked to approve. Landing it takes a SECOND invocation carrying `--confirm`
   (and `--push`), which is the action that happens after the `y`. A decline is
   therefore not a code path that has to behave; it is the absence of one, and
   `TestDeclineWritesNothing` hashes the whole repo tree either side of a
   default-mode run to keep it that way.

c. THE STATUS HEADER IS REPLACED; THE FINDINGS APPEND. "State now" / "Next
   steps" / "How to verify" are current state and are overwritten. "Open
   investigations", "Findings" and "Gotchas / decisions / dead-ends" are the
   live diagnosis state the skill itself calls "the single highest-value part
   of the handoff", so an update APPENDS to them and the earlier text survives
   verbatim. The incident is the argument: that update *superseded* an earlier
   interpretation, and the value is seeing the prior reading was corrected —
   not finding it silently gone. Appending is deliberately dumb: a new block
   with the SAME heading as an old one still appends, because supersession is
   exactly the case worth keeping both halves of.

d. NO ADVANCE, NO OFFER. `--advanced` is a required, non-empty statement of
   what changed since the doc was written. Without it — or with one of the
   sentinels that MEAN nothing changed — this exits 4 having printed no diff at
   all. Not an empty diff, not a no-op commit: no offer. A resume that goes
   nowhere overwriting a good handoff is the worst case and the one nobody
   notices until they try to retry cleanly. The honesty of `--advanced` is on
   the caller, so there is a second, independent guard that does not depend on
   it: if the merge produces content equal to what is already on disk, that is
   exit 5 `no-change`, also with no diff and no commit.

WHAT IS OUT OF SCOPE HERE. Whether `/handoff` should push at all in a repo
whose trunk is the deploy branch is a per-repo policy question, not this
module's. It pushes only when asked to, only to the remote and branch it is
given, and only together with `--confirm`.
