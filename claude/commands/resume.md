# /resume — re-enter from a handoff

Goal: rebuild context fast and **verify it's still true** before acting (a handoff reflects what was true when written — live state may have moved).

Topic argument (optional): `$ARGUMENTS`.

## Steps

1. **Locate the handoff**: if a topic is given, read `claudedocs/handoff-<topic>.md`; otherwise find the most recently modified `claudedocs/handoff-*.md` in the active repo (`ls -t claudedocs/handoff-*.md | head`). If none exists, say so and offer to reconstruct state from git/PRs instead.

2. **Read it fully.**

3. **Re-verify against live state — run the deterministic reconciler, don't hand-roll it:**
   ```bash
   bash ~/workspace/devrc/scripts/resume-state.sh "$ARGUMENTS"
   ```
   This is the initiative-scoped, on-demand collector (modeled on `standup.sh`). It resolves the handoff, then reconciles it against FRESH live state in one call and prints a compact digest: `GIT/PR` (branch ahead/behind, dirty, referenced PR states + CI, branch existence), `WORKLOAD` (handoff-named deployment readiness + canary phase — v1: datapacket), `ALERTS` (firing alerts scoped to the initiative's namespace), and a `DRIFT` block. **Interpret the digest — especially `DRIFT`** (the lines where live state contradicts the handoff, e.g. a PR the doc calls in-flight has already merged). Do NOT re-derive this by hand-rolling `git`/`kubectl`/`gh`. It degrades gracefully (git-only) when a source is unreachable or the repo isn't datapacket; only reach for a targeted `kubectl`/`gh` drill-down if the digest flags something needing one.

4. **Report**:
   - One-paragraph "where things stand" (reconciled with what you just verified).
   - **Ranked next steps**, with the single highest-leverage action first.
   - Any drift you found between the handoff and live state.

Then wait for direction. Pair: `/handoff`.
