# /initiatives — durable initiative + progress ledger

Runs the read-only `initiative-scan` report and presents it. This is the durable, cross-session counterpart to the live Alt+i tmux view (which only shows sessions open right now). Args: `$ARGUMENTS` (passed through to the script; default `--days 4`).

## Session snapshot / restore (survive a reboot)

If `$ARGUMENTS` is **`snapshot`** (or `save`), **`restore`** (optionally `restore --dry-run`), or **`show`**, run the workspace snapshot helper instead of the scan — it binds each live claude tmux window to its exact session id (by matching pane content) so you can bring the whole workspace back after a reboot. tmux-continuum already restores the sessions/windows/cwds; this relaunches the right `claude --resume <id>` in each.

```bash
python3 ~/workspace/devrc/scripts/tmux-session-restore.py <snapshot|restore|show> [--dry-run]
```
- **`snapshot`** — run BEFORE rebooting: writes `~/.config/initiatives/restore-plan.json` + a readable `restore-cheatsheet.md` (survives reboot). Present the cheat-sheet.
- **`restore`** — run AFTER reboot (once tmux-continuum has restored the shells): relaunches `claude --resume <id>` in each window; windows already running claude are skipped, and windows with no certain match fall back to the interactive picker. Use `--dry-run` first to preview.
- **⚠ host-local:** run it on the host you're rebooting — it reads that host's live tmux + `~/.claude/projects`. The plan is per-host.

## Steps

1. **Load the ClickHouse read-only reader creds** (for the telemetry/momentum columns). The script **degrades gracefully** without them (handoff + git only), so if this fails, still proceed.
   ```bash
   git -C ~/workspace/homelab-talos fetch origin trunk -q 2>/dev/null
   git -C ~/workspace/homelab-talos show origin/trunk:clusters/homelab/apps/activity/secrets.enc.yaml > /tmp/ch.yaml 2>/dev/null
   export CLICKHOUSE_URL=http://192.168.50.94:30123 CLICKHOUSE_USER=activity_reader
   export CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD=$(SOPS_AGE_KEY_FILE=~/workspace/homelab-talos/.secrets/age.key \
       sops -d --extract '["stringData"]["reader-password"]' /tmp/ch.yaml 2>/dev/null); rm -f /tmp/ch.yaml
   ```
   - **Host note:** `192.168.50.94:30123` is the workbench LAN endpoint. On the **laptop** (no `~/.server-mode` marker, nebula-only) that's unreachable → the report runs **telemetry-OFF** (still useful from handoff + git). To get telemetry there, point `CLICKHOUSE_URL` at the laptop's nebula CH endpoint — see the `activity` skill.

2. **Run the scan** (substitute `$ARGUMENTS`, or `--days 4 --tmux` if none):
   ```bash
   nix-shell -p 'python3.withPackages(p:[p.requests])' --run \
     'python ~/workspace/devrc/scripts/session-analysis/initiative-scan.py --days 4 --tmux'
   ```
   - **`--tmux`** links each initiative to the live tmux session(s) hosting it — `[tmux:8,scratch7]` vs `[no session]` — by matching the claude pane's title (its session summary) against the initiative slug/title, scoped by the pane's cwd→repo. It also lists **live claude sessions with no matched initiative** (open work the ledger doesn't cover). Best-effort: on a host with no tmux server the column is silently omitted. This is the durable ledger fused with the live Alt+i view. Drop `--tmux` if `$ARGUMENTS` explicitly overrides.

3. **Present the output as-is** — it's already a ranked, skimmable report grouped by repo. Optionally lead with a one-line read: which initiatives are ●ACTIVE vs the most notable ○stalled one, and any next-step that looks owed. **Do not editorialize beyond the data** — momentum is *recency of touch, NOT % done*, and both initiative↔commit and initiative↔tmux-session linking are heuristic (see the script's honesty notes; a multi-topic pane title may attach to one of several co-hosted initiatives).
